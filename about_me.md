title: About Me
---

Hey there! My name is David Audet and I am a software developer in Vancouver, B.C.

I graduated in 2011 from The University of Victoria with a BSc in Computer Science.
Since then, I spent almost three years working for Ericsson on Network Management.
Currently I am working for Siaras Research Canada Inc. developing cloud orchestration
tools using OpenStack and Python.

In my spare time I enjoy playing Ice Hockey and playing the electric guitar. I am also
an avid bicycle and motorcycle rider. 

I wouldn't be able to do what I do without the loving support from my wonderful wife Leila.
