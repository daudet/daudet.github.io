title: OpenStack Summit 2015
---

Having worked with the OpenStack framework for over a year now, it is very cool that the next OpenStack summit will be in Vancouver, B.C. this May.

I haven't looked at the presentation schedule yet, but hope to catch at least a few presentations/workshops. I need to 
take advantage of this opportunity to connect with other OpenStack developers without having to fly to another city.
