title: Rub with Love
---

I know what you're thinking, Rub with Love? Get your mind out of the gutter. It's actually a store opened by Tom Douglas, a Seattle restauranteur, which sell a wide range of seasoning rubs for meat. I was first told about the place when a colleague asked me to pick him up some during a visit to Seattle last year. At first I thought it was a joke...I would be walking around Market Square asking where I could find a rub with love...haha. But it turns out it is a real place and the rubs are amazing. We decided to pick up the steak rub, which was excellent, but soon ran out (we bought the small one). Now whenever we hear of someone going to Seattle we ask them to try to pick us up some. 

This all changed this week when my wife was able to find Rub with Love at a nearby Home Sense. The best part is that it seems to be about the same price up here as it was down in Seattle. I am not sure if this is just a one-off product that they are carrying for a limited time or if it is something that they will have on a continued basis. I told my work colleague about this find and he is going to see if he can find it too at his local Home Sense. Not that we won't be going to Seattle again, but this means that we can enjoy this great rub more often now.
