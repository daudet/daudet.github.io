title: Rub with Love
---

I know what you're thinking, Rub with Love? Get your mind out of the gutter. It's actually a store opened by Tom Douglas, a Seattle restauranteur, which sell a wide range of seasoning rubs for meat. I was first told about the place when a colleague asked me to pick him up some during a visit to Seattle last year. At first I thought it was a joke...I would be walking around Market Square asking where I could find a rub with love...haha. But it turns out it is a real place and the rubs are amazing.
