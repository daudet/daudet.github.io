title: Habs Sweep Bruins
---

I watched the Habs play the Bruins last night. The Habs have really had the Bruin's number this season. Again Montreal dominated
the play and managed to win their 4th straight against the Bruins this season! Looking at the stats, this hasn't happened since the 1944-1945 season. That's the end of this rivalry matchup...at least until the postseason. Go Habs Go!!!
