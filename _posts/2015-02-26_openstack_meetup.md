title: OpenStack Meetup at POF
---

Chris and I went to an OpenStack MeetUp last week. Midokura had a couple of representatives there discussing MidoNet (their neutron replacement for O/S). There was also a few people from a Cinder Backend company called SolidFire. Their big sell was that they are using all SolidState drives and support disk QoS natively.

It was interesting listening to the MidoNet presentation having just recently worked with it in a deployment.

It was also pretty cool to see who else is out there working on OpenStack in Vancouver. We got free pizza and beer and had a chance to find out where the Plenty of Fish 'Aquarium' is located. The event was put on by Auro, an OpenStack provider run locally in Vancouver. We'll definitely have to go to another one...maybe we could even present something sometime soon.
