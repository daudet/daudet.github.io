title: Lynn Valley Loop

Today Leila and I went for a hike in Lynn Valley. I don't think either of us had ever been, but since it's so close,
not sure why. We decided to do the loop trail, which is about ~1.5-2 hours (for an average speed). There are some
steeper sections, but for the most part it is pretty easy going. We saw quite a few people which was a surprise to me
since it wasn't the nicest of days. We mananged to miss most of the rain, but did catch some on our way back to the car.
We will definitely have to add this spot to this summer's hike plans. There seem to be 3-4 other longer hikes that
we'll have to try.
